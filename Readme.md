The main idea is to use the [DiagramContainer](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WPF/117205/Controls-and-Libraries/Diagram-Control/Diagram-Items/Containers) element to combine several shapes that will be used as input and output points. 
To prevent attaching connectors to inappropriate points, it's necessary to handle the [QueryConnectionPoints](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Diagram.DiagramControl.QueryConnectionPoints.event) event.
